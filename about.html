              Hey!
            </h2>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
              I'm Aaron, a Photographer Based in Edinburgh, Scotland!<br>
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: left;">
              My primary style has been Landscape Photography, as I had so much beautiful country around me at home in Royal Deeside. After moving to Edinburgh, and with
              my own personal preference, I began to focus more on  <a href = "portraits.html">Portraits</a>, <a href = "urban.html">and Urban/City</a> Photography.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
              I've included some other styles of photos in the <a href = "gallery.html">gallery</a> section to showcase things I've dabbled in but aren't necessarily my primary focus.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: left;">
              Also side note, I started coding this website for a Web Technologies module at University, where we were taught how to create websites.<br>
              It was a great chance to both learn how to create websites, but also have something super useful I can use
              at the end of it!<br>
              I kept it going after I completed the module as I was enjoying what I was doing and this is the result, my site, coded myself! <br>
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
              Any questions or to get in touch send me a message on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aaron__watkins/"target="_blank">Instagram: @aaron__watkins</a></li>
